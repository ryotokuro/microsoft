# Using LinkedIn

## Reach new heights

LinkedIn is a great platform to reach people at different stages in their career. For me, I can search up people who are currently working in roles that I am interested in and get answers to questions that previously may have been left unanswered. The access it provides to a network of professionals is unparalleled and fills a need for workers and employers alike.

## Researching the role

I've previously already interviewed for the Cloud Solutions Architect role at Microsoft, and made it quite far. Unfortunately, I wasn't successful and perhaps fell short in comparison to the last two candidates. Since then, the role has been framed directly as the '**Azure Application & Infrastructure Specialist**' role, but the job listing doesn't seem to have any information on what it actually involves.

So to better prepare myself this time round, I've taken the initiative to reach out to current interns in the role to ask them about their experience and opinion on what I could do to increase my chances of success. In particular, I would like to know things like:

* What knowledge/skills are most valuable to have for this role?
* What do interns do in this role?
* What area do you focus on in Azure?
* What learning paths are best to prepare for this role?
