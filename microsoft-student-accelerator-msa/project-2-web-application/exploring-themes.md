# My idea

Here's the idea. I already have a [website ](https://ryotokuro.github.io/)and a blog \(what you're reading right now\). So I don't see a point in creating another one especially since I have more flexibility and long-term stability by having it hosted on GitHub pages \(since my student subscription on Azure will eventually run out\).

Despite this, I still want to still create a website that is interesting and will hopefully be of some use beyond letting me experiment and learn how to use Azure in conjunction with Wordpress. So my idea is to create a website/blog for the Microsoft Student Accelerator program that I'm currently taking part in. At the moment, their documentation and material is all on GitHub natively as markdown files, but there's no front-end website \(previously there was [msa.ms](https://msa.ms)\) that can interface for the public or non-technical people who aren't familiar with GitHub's layout.

So I figure it'll be much nicer to build something out as a base prototype in spirit of Microsoft and the Accelerator branding. I'll set it up so it's not too corporate and accessible and have placeholder blog posts and links to their existing resources if anyone where to somehow land there.
