# For Schools

The first thing on this page is a link that **directs students and teachers to different sections on the page**. For the students, they are directed towards the **About section**, informing them about the program and the Teachers have their own section on how to get involved.

## Videos

These seem to be hosted on Azure so they can be played using the default video player without navigating away from the website. Might be a good idea to separate those and have this as a information site since there is an external resource available [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/MSA-School-Game-Development-Series).

Then less work needs to be done on maintaining these videos if new courses are uploaded, they can all be deployed on Channel 9.

## Facebook Group

Looks like the facebook group is still there, but private.
