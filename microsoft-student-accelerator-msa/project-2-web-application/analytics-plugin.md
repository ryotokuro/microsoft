# Traffic Monitoring and Analytics

To track user traffic and behaviour on my website, I'll be using the MonsterInsights plugin that covers Google analytics for my website.

## Setting up

To set up, I just navigated through the plugin wizard. What I need to do is link my Google Analytics account to MonsterInsights, which will deliver the results regularly to my email. The process can be done for free following the steps outlined at [https://analytics.google.com/](https://analytics.google.com/).

## Dashboard and reports

Now the traffic and usage data for my website will be sent to Google Analytics and displayed or exported from there. Moreover, with the connection all this data is forwarded to my Wordpress plugin which can be seen on the application dashboard.
