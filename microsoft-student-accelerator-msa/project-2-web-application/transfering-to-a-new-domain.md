# Transfering to a new domain

After debating what domain name I wanted previously, I settled with **aumsa** as the one I wanted. The problem however, is that **custom domains are only supported with paid Azure plans**. This means that if I were to use my custom domain as a CNAME, I would have to transfer all my resources to a new plan.

For this iteration I don't think it's necessary - so after much debate and some research online, I resolved to **changing the name of the website and using my custom domain as a redirect**.

## Changing the website name

While there isn't a option to directly change the name of your website deployed in Azure, you can create a new Wordpress app and configure to move your application over.
