# Exploring themes

## A customisable theme

So I'm not too keen on being restricted to design based on a theme. I'd much prefer to be able to move things around and change things to how I would like.

## Builder

Both Elementor and Beaver Builder are the two most popular page builders. However, there are a few key differences for what they offer detailed [here](https://www.collectiveray.com/beaver-builder-vs-elementor).

**Bottom line**  
Elementor works best with the features on the free plan when compared to Beaver builder.
