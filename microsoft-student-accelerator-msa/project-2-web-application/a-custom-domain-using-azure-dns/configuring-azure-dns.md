# Configuring Azure DNS

To configure [Azure DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/host-domain-azure-dns/3-configure-azure-dns-host-domain), I'll start by first creating a DNS Zone through Azure.

So I just add a new DNS zone under my student subscription... or... don't?

Apparently F1 \(Free\) tiers and this subscription doesn't support any custom domain or DNS hosting so this kinda sucks..
