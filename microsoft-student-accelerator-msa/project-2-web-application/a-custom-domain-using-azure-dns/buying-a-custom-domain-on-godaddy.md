# Buying a custom domain on GoDaddy

So for a custom domain, I'll be using GoDaddy to find what's available and affordable. After searching around for a bit and testing a few different names, I settled on [https://aumsa.co/](https://aumsa.co/). It fits within the theme of the NZ program, and covers all of Australia so it can scale outwards to programs in the greater AU region.

I'll have this domain for a year, so hopefully I can make use of it and continue to build on this website beyond the project submission.

## Not configuring a custom domain

So I found that I can't configure the domain through Wordpress Admin and Azure doesn't support custom domains on Free/Student tier subscriptions so I think I've lucked out. This isn't very good at all so I'm not sure what I can do here...
