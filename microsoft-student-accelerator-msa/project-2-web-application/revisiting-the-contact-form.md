# Revisiting the contact form

## Layout

### Email configuration

To configure the email, I'm just making sure all the settings are fine and directing to my personal email for testing. The title is also extremely important to guide users to the form and for SEO indexing.

### Fields

Regarding information to collect, I'm curious about what kind of users they are before they ask a question, since the answers will differ. For different audiences, their intentions and interest in the program will vary greatly; for example:

* **Students** may want to know about how to join the program
* **Teachers** may want their education institute to get involved to co-create learning content
* **Employers** may be interested in partnering with the MSP Team to offer work-based experience

## Anti-Spam Protection

### reCAPTCHA

Setting up reCAPTCHA is actually very easy. You simply enter your website domain, specify which type of reCAPTCHA that you're after and **Google will generate you a public and private key pair**.

After that, you just enter that into the settings and stylise how it looks.

What's great about this is that Google even provides options to configure your security settings of the CAPTCHA. You can adjust the difficulty to make it harder/easier for users/bots to solve to ensure that you actually are getting legitimate requests.

Moreover, Google provides an **Analytics dashboard that displays the number of times your CAPTCHA has been interacted with over time**. This helps you identify what kind of traffic is going through your form and how exposed it is.

### Akismet Filtering

We've touched on Akismet previously, but I have yet to set it up on this site. Since I previously configured it for the old domain, I'll have to go in and change it for this contact form.
