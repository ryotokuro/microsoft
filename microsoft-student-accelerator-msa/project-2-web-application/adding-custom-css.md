# Adding custom CSS

So with Elementor Page Builder I have to **pay to add my own custom CSS**. That's kind of a bummer - so I'll be editing custom CSS through the default editor that exists on the side panel.

In order to overwrite some of the default theme settings, I'll have to mark some fields as **`!important`** to make sure my changes go through intentionally.
