# Global elements

## Header

At the moment I'm sticking with the Microsoft styling since it's cleaner. However, I think I might want to redesign the MSA logo and incorporate that instead as MSA has it's own unique branding as explored previously. As for links, I'll in future add a **'Programs'** page that has information about the Student, Teacher and Kids program \(Imagine Cup\).

## Footer

Not sure if I want to advertise my own social links, but I think if MSA wanted to use this website layout then it would be more professional and beneficial for them to have their social links already integrated. So I've gone ahead and included those into the footer as you can see below.

The GitHub link unfortunately doesn't have a square design so I might create a custom one or end up having to remove it..
