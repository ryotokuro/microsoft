# Customising the front page

## Removing the page title

This is quite jarring, but I want to keep it simply for SEO to show up on search engines like Google or Bing whenever you search up 'Microsoft Student Accelerator'. So I just need to remove it from the front page. Setting the size doesn't seem to work, so I'll be **editing the CSS to set the property to `display:none`.**

## Featured Image

The featured image is one of the most important elements of the front page, being the first thing that users will see. It's important that I not only select a significant image, **but also have a relevant title and subtext, and a call-to-action button that is useful**.

Also, for accessibility and SEO, I should also include an **`alt`** tag for the images I use.

Here's what I ended up with. I used the image of the New Zealand MSA team as the background, used the name of the website as the heading \(`h1`\) with the tagline slightly modified. As well as that, I've changed the button to be a "register link" that directs to the AU MSA Facebook page.

## About section

For this section, I was deciding whether or not I should go with the values or the actual content of the program. In the end, I went with the latter, using some icons+header to identify areas of interest that MSA fulfils. However, still might want some style changes - **maybe adding some colour to the icons or boldness to the headers.**

## Microsoft Student Partners

Not sure if this has been rebranded to **Microsoft Learn Ambassadors** \(could be a different thing\), but I know that they always are after new partners, so I thought it would be good to have a section for it. I've decided to include the current body of Student Partners that I know of \(tentative\) following the style structure below.

At the moment this section is quite poorly styled, so I'll definitely look to redesign it, but mostly the elements I need are all there.
