# Implementing SEO

I'll just be going with the most popular option, having **over 5 million installations** and a **5 star rating**, I think this is the most logical choice.

## Contact page

To optimise the contact page, I'll be referring to the analysis on the right hand side which changes as I edit the contents. This is super nice to let me know if I'm on the right track and alerts me on what to change if I'm not being optimal anywhere. It's like having the marking rubric right next to you outlined nicely, pointing things out so you can perfect your writing. Super neat.
