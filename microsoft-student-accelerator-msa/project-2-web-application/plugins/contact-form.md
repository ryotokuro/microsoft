# Contact Form

To create a contact form, I'll be using the Contact Form 7 to generate the HTML for me. Although this is pretty easy to set up in HTML, it's much easier for me to edit and configure using a plugin without having to mess around too much. If need be I can always go into the back and alter a few things anyway.

So to use Contact Form 7, I just had to activate the plugin after installing
