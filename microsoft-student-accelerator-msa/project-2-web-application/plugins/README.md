## Most Popular

The first thing that is always good to check out is the Most Popular section in a marketplace. What do people usually use on their Wordpress websites - and then considering whether or not I'll need that in my website or not.

Here I've gone ahead and looked at the top 9 plugins and boxed the ones I think will be useful for my website. From there I can figure out what other things I want to include and flesh out the different dependencies that my website will require to support them.

### Contact Form

I definitely want some form of contact for the websites. Students, teachers and companies alike should be able to ask any questions they might have or reach out to provide an initial contact if they are interested in the program.

The advantage with a contact form is that it's easily accessible for users who are already on the website. People don't have to leave your website to send through a query. Moreover, a contact form is clean and simple to fill out without requiring you to expose any private information \(such as your email\) to collect responses.
