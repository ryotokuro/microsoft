# Research on Microsoft

Microsoft founded in 1975 is known all across the world with a reputation that places it among the top of all companies in existence. Since its inception, Microsoft has grown to such a scale that it c**oncerns itself with all sorts of global issues and tackles a variety of interesting problems daily**. This means that every day, hundreds of thousands of employees at Microsoft are innovating and doing something to change the world on a level that is unparalleled.

With so much internal and external change, news on Microsoft and what it does in all of its different areas is hard to keep up with. There's thousands of articles that come out every time something happens which is overwhelming for someone to try and understand the multifaceted nature of the company. Thankfully, Microsoft puts all this information out there on its website, pushing updates regularly and providing a space where relevant news is collated in accessible places.

The first stage of this Virtual Internship was to try and understand Microsoft as a company -

* Where did Microsoft come from?
* What does Microsoft do?
* What is Microsoft's mission?

These are all questions that fundamentally define the construct of Microsoft, and is critical knowledge to understanding a company completely.
