# Research on Microsoft

## The tech giant, Microsoft

Microsoft founded in 1975 is known all across the world with a reputation that places it among the top of all companies in existence. Since its inception, Microsoft has grown to such a scale that it c**oncerns itself with all sorts of global issues and tackles a variety of interesting problems daily**. This means that every day, hundreds of thousands of employees at Microsoft are innovating and doing something to change the world on a level that is unparalleled.

With so much internal and external change, news on Microsoft and what it does in all of its different areas is hard to keep up with. There's thousands of articles that come out every time something happens which is overwhelming for someone to try and understand the multifaceted nature of the company. Thankfully, Microsoft puts all this information out there on its website, pushing updates regularly and providing a space where relevant news is collated in accessible places.

The first stage of this Virtual Internship was to try and understand Microsoft as a company -

* Where did Microsoft come from?
* What does Microsoft do?
* What is Microsoft's mission?

These are all questions that fundamentally define the construct of Microsoft, and is critical knowledge to understanding a company completely.

## Research Resources

For this project, I was tasked to do some research on Microsoft to understand a few key aspects about its business. So I was given some resources to find out more about the company and to address some of the points denoted above. Things such as:

* What Microsoft does currently \(because it's not just computers\)
* Who are the key figures in Microsoft \(who is on the Board\)
* What the financial structure and operation of the company is like

### Resource 1: Facts About Microsoft

Reading through the two resources, already there's an overwhelming sense of scale and achievement that Microsoft has. Just scrolling through the long list of **milestones the company has reached** over the years - every year they seem to have several highlights for the company. I mean it's hard to name any other company that really is just this consistent year to year besides other highly valued tech companies. So it's easy to justify why exactly they're on top and known by almost everyone in the world.

Going through the history of the company, even from the very beginning it was wildly successful and more ambitious than other businesses. We can attribute this success to its founders and the people who joined the company early on - building the basis for the superb growth of the company. I mean **in just 6 years from its creation \(1981\) the company incorporated and collaborated with IBM** \(the forefront of computing at the time\) to release the **first version of Microsoft's operating system MS-DOS 1.0**. It's crazy to think this just happened in our timeline - and its been 40 years since then.

Very quickly after that, **Microsoft went public 5 years later in 1986** which is a remarkable feat again for companies especially 11 years after it was created. Following that, Microsoft went on to build on its operating system and had such iconic releases namely **Windows 95 and Windows 98**. So just looking at the direction at the time, the company was very focused and **intent on achieving its mission at the time**. That is:

**Microsoft's previous mission statement**  
A computer on every desk, and in every home \(running Microsoft software\)
{% endhint %}

Then in the naughties era we hit what I would consider **the golden age**, where Microsoft started to expand its reaches and look toward new frontiers - alongside continuing to improve its operating system \(Windows\). Its here where the technology for my generation was started and began making its way into our childhood and inevitably create a world with a PC on every working desk.
