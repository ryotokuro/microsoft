# InsideSherpa & Background

## What is InsideSherpa?

InsideSherpa is a platform that collaborates with companies across various industries to **deliver virtual training for users to experience what it is like to work at their company of interest**. This offers the advantages of a traditional internship with the benefits of an online course experience, delivering a modular learning structure that has been curated by professionals in that space and can be taken by users in their own time and following their own pace.

While this doesn't provide as much depth or complexity as a real internship with more competitive intake and higher stakes, it serves as a window into companies which people previously may not have had the chance to look into. This exposes new and upcoming talent to potential companies they may want to work for and positions they may want to fill by providing a reponsibility which mirrors that of a real intern.

## This Virtual Internship

_So with the numerous internships that InsideSherpa provides, why have I chosen to only do this one?_

Certainly, there are many interesting companies and opportunities that InsideSherpa offers virtual internships for, however I have chosen this because it heavily aligns with my interests. Previously I have undertaken some InsideSherpa virtual internships with financial companies as a developer/engineering role, but without the motivation and interest to learn about those businesses, it was hard to push myself and enjoy what I was doing.

Here I find a combination of two things that I value highly and have great interest in: being **Microsoft** and **Engineering**. As someone who has always wanted to work at Microsoft and applied several times without any luck, I've always been looking for opportunities where I could grow and understand more about the internal operations of the company. Being on the outside, I could only view what Microsoft presented to the world without a true understanding of how the company worked and what employees do day-to-day. So seeing this opportunity arise, I felt compelled to take this chance to go through the virtual internship in hopes that I can learn a lot and perhaps bring it to my next application for Microsoft.

Next with Engineering - as someone who is currently pursuing my degree in Engineering, I merely have an academic point of view as to what Engineering is. That is, the theory: the mathematics, the physics, the programming - all these foundational concepts that are taught in University but rarely applied practically as you would in the workforce. Seeing this internship therefore allows me to see **how Engineering is conducted in one of the most established Engineering companies in the world** and position myself to be a better engineer for the future.
