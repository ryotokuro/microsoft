# Goal Tracking

After completing the SMART goals module, I created this page to help me actively keep track of my progress through the internships as I document on gitbook. I'll be using a checklist format to mark off what modules I have completed and see which ones I still have in the pipeline.

As a reminder, my SMART goal was:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complete both Microsoft virtual internships** with InsideSherpa by **doing at least two modules every week** for two hours \(restricting time spent using a timer\) **before the 16th of August**.
{% endhint %}
