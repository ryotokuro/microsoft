# Goal Tracking

After completing the SMART goals module, I created this page to help me actively keep track of my progress through the internships as I document on gitbook. I'll be using a checklist format to mark off what modules I have completed and see which ones I still have in the pipeline.

As a reminder, my SMART goal was:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Complete both Microsoft virtual internships** with InsideSherpa by **doing at least two modules every week** for two hours \(restricting time spent using a timer\) **before the 16th of August**.
{% endhint %}

**Update 22/07**:

Underestimated the depth of these modules and how busy I would be during this university period. While I'm trying to juggle university and learning and preparing for interviews with multiple companies, I've decided to shift my focus to fully completing the Engineering internship and finding time next month to complete the GTM before I touch face with Microsoft \(assuming I pass the resume stage...\).
