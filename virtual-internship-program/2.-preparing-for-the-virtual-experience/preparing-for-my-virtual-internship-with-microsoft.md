# Preparing for my virtual internship with Microsoft

## Background

### A better understanding of the workplace

For this task, I hopefully should gain a better understanding of what it means to be an intern at Microsoft. Reflecting on my own knowledge about the workforce, there is so little that I know due to having minimal experience and exposure - so hopefully after this I'll able to at least know what things I need to learn about working in the workplace.

For Microsoft in particular, it is regarded as a **home of empowerment**, echoing the philosophy of the company's mission. Being a large-scale company that is cemented across the globe, **any work that is done here is going to be used by people around the world and depended upon**, having a impact on their lives.

As such, it is important for Microsoft to remain agile and at the forefront of the technology landscape, which is why they push so heavily for innovation, especially with the rise of [**Intelligent cloud and intelligent edge**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/future-of-cloud/). The resources, people and expertise that exists at Microsoft create an environment for anyone who works there to be able to contribute to the mission of empowerment and be able to stand as an individual in order to plant their own dreams from their time there.

### About the task

This tasks gives some insight into how engineering interns operate at Microsoft and what working there is like. More specifically, I'll be watching a video that features previous interns who worked in Engineering at Microsoft talking about their experiences and detailing the benefits from working at the company.

As someone who is extremely passionate about learning and improving every day, what continues to push me towards Microsoft is the culture of inclusivity and environment for growth that it fosters and promotes. Every person who I have spoken to who works at Microsoft has a purpose and feels like their work matters and has an impact on their local community and the world around them.

There is no discrimination between people regardless of where they come from or what they do - they are all united under the common mission; to empower others to achieve more. It is this direction that has made the company more diverse and innovative than before, bringing great people from all corners of the world and at different stages in life to make a difference to the world. This is what inspires me as someone who went into Engineering in pursuit of solving problems to help people.

Moreover, Microsoft who is at the forefront of technology has an abundance of resources and people at the company, creating an environment where you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Whether you want to learn some obscure language like COBOL or create a brilliant cloud application, Microsoft has the tools and information to accelerate your learning, as well as a community to support your journey to answer your questions or provide direction for you. This gives tremendous opportunity for anyone within the company to further themselves and develop lifelong skills that are useful inside and outside of their career. Just being fortunate enough to be working at Microsoft gives you so much opportunity beyond the work that you do, making it the ideal workplace for people like me.
