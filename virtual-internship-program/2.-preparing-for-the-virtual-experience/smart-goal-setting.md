# SMART goal setting

## Background

Goal setting is a helpful way to build the career you want. By setting objectives and creating a clear roadmap for how youâ€™ll reach your intended target, you can decide how to apply your time and resources to make progress. Without goals, it can be difficult to determine how to get a certain job, promotion or other milestones you want to achieve.
