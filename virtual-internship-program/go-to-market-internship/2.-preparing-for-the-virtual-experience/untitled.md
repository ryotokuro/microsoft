# Asia Pacific Internship Experience

## 1. What excites you about working at Microsoft?

As an intern said in the video, working at Microsoft can be explosive and dynamic, consisting of speed bumps and uncertainties along the way. This means that journey will be turbulent and pose different challenges - however not without reward. By overcoming the challenging nature of working at Microsoft, you come out the other end as a better person; someone who is more resolute and confident about their abilities.

As such, the challenges that you face when working are possible and designed to push you in the right direction. Moreover, Microsoft is a collaborative environment where the people around you are always willing to lend you a hand whenever you need help. Therefore, the opportunity to be in that environment where I can tackle any problem that comes my way is extremely exciting for me!

Additionally, challenge can bear interesting results in the workplace, which is usually associated with mundaneness and non-variety. By placing you in situations and giving you opportunities unlike any other, you are placed in the best position to grow and improve for your career. What's more, people are given equal footing and treated seriously. There is no babysitting or downplaying; it's a place where adults are fully supporting one another under Microsoft's common mission. 

## 2. What opportunities do you see at Microsoft to utilize your knowledge and skills?

Having experience technical field, I would say that my skills are best utilised in roles that require some form of technical knowledge. These could be both purely technical roles \(such as developers or engineers\) or people-facing roles \(like evangelists or workshops\). In addition, since I have worked as a tutor and within the customer-service industry, I am also well equipped to work in customer-facing roles \(such as support roles or advisory\).

More specifically, as a business technology company, Microsoft brings that perfect blend that matches my palette perfectly. Having access to the new wave of software and technology \(such as Cloud, VR and AI\), I will be able to utilise my prior knowledge to adapt to the upcoming technological trends and endlessly innovate within Microsoft.

## 3. What impressions did the Microsoft interns in the video give you about the culture at Microsoft?

The Microsoft interns praised Microsoft for being a place of support and growth. They were able to work in a safe place that was inclusive and accepting for who they were \(**Come as you are, do what you love**\) and given avenues and opportunities to excel and grow. By placing them in unique situations \(such as judging competitions and advising startup companies\), the interns were free to explore and experience the different sides of the company.

As well as this, the interns did not feel undermined or undervalued in any way. Instead, they were treated as mature working adults and given responsibilities with impact on their teams and communities and support was provided to them when they needed.
