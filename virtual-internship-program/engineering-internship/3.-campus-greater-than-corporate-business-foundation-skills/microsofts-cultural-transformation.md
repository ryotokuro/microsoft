# Microsoft's cultural transformation

This module is all about exploring how Satya Nadella has transformed Microsoft's culture in the last half-decade \(since 2014\). It revolves around discovering how culture shapes how employees within the organisation **live, behave and work together** - which attributes greatly to the success of the company.

Of this, the **key value that Microsoft establishes is a Growth Mindset** - and the four attributes that allow this value to flourish within the company. These four attributes are:

1. Customer Obsession
2. Diversity & Inclusion in everything Microsoft does and creates
3. Operating as one company \(instead of scattered units\)
4. Making a difference to all \(fellow employees, customers and the world\)
