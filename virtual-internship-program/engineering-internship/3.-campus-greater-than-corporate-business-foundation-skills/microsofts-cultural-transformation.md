# Microsoft's cultural transformation

This module is all about exploring how Satya Nadella has transformed Microsoft's culture in the last half-decade \(since 2014\). It revolves around discovering how culture shapes how employees within the organisation **live, behave and work together** - which attributes greatly to the success of the company.

Of this, the **key value that Microsoft establishes is a Growth Mindset** - and the four attributes that allow this value to flourish within the company. These four attributes are:

1. Customer Obsession
2. Diversity & Inclusion in everything Microsoft does and creates
3. Operating as one company \(instead of scattered units\)
4. Making a difference to all \(fellow employees, customers and the world\)

## Microsoft's Culture

For this task I was provided with a slide deck containing information on the current state of Microsoft's culture and the attributes that define it. It has a neat design and goes over it quite concisely, given that this is probably used in presentation to educate onboarding employees about Microsoft.

### Microsoft's Story

To understand Microsoft and where it is now, the best thing is to go back and retrace the story of the organisation; this story covers **the past \(how Microsoft came to be\), the present \(how Microsoft is now\) and the future \(where Microsoft is headed\)**. This is covered in detail on their website located [here](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/culture).

## Microsoft's Cultural Attributes

Microsoft's culture begins with believing that **the company can always learn and grow**. It's with this mindset that the company continues to move towards the future to their mission "to empower every person and organisation on the planet to achieve more". So this **growth mindset** is applied to everything that Microsoft does;

* When **interacting with customers**, Microsoft is thinking: how can we **better learn and adapt to the needs of our customers**? 
* When making the workplace more **diverse and inclusive**, ****Microsoft is thinking: how can we improve our current culture and **continue to apply diversity and inclusivity** in other areas? 
* When **working together as one**, Microsoft is thinking: how can we **unify the different departments within our organisation** to strive towards our mission? 
* When trying to **make a difference**, Microsoft is thinking: how can we make more of an impact on the world to enact positive change in areas that need it the most?
