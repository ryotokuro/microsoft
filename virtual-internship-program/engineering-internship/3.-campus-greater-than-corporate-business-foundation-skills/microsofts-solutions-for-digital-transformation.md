# Microsoft's solutions for digital transformation

## An unprecedented opportunity

{% embed url="https://news.microsoft.com/features/nadella-to-partners-we-have-an-unprecedented-opportunity/" %}

What differentiates Microsoft from its competition is the organisation's focus on the mission. If you ask me what the mission of Apple or Amazon is, I wouldn't be able to tell you. Google is something to like 'index all the information in the world', but even that doesn't give a good sense of what the individual employees are doing, given the scale of the company.

On the other hand, Microsoft has its focus on empowering people and organisations across the world in all industries. This mission represents the company - **how they utilise technology to help people achieve more.** Microsoft celebrates the fact that technology is able to help customers succeed and realise their dreams. And not only do these include the 150,000 direct employees at Microsoft, but also extends to the several million companies that partner with Microsoft.

While technology and **technology paradigms come and go**, **Microsoft stays steadfast** and committed to its mission.

## A mobile, cloud-first era

So in 2017, Satya declared Microsoft's shift towards the technology of the new age, moving the company towards a **mobile-first, cloud-first world by focusing its roots in the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge**.

### Multi-device, multi-sense

The first characteristic of this evolution is Microsoft's dedication to supporting multiple devices and multiple senses. **Multi-dimensional means that** **Microsoft brings its digital experience to every device - on big screens, small screens or sensors with no screens**. As everyone now carries their own device, the experience is no longer bound to one device that you need to carry everywhere. It simply travels with you wherever you go.

With **multi-sense**, the experience now transcends across different ways of interacting. You can **start the experience by touch \(on your phone\) and end it using speech on another device**. This makes it seamless to move with technology and more accessible for users with limited sensory capabilities.

### Artificial Intelligence

We're all quite familiar with AI and its potential to improve experiences; making them more personalised and intelligent. Microsoft has resolved to embed Artificial Intelligence into all their experiences using Cloud capabilities. This means that no matter what digital experience you're interacting with, its powered by AI.

### Serverless

The final piece of the puzzle is having a **backend to facilitate these experiences**. Serverless is Microsoft's **need and thread to stitch together the fabric of their experiences**. Serverless makes it possible for Microsoft to build applications that can be deployed across multiple devices \(using **containers and serverless technology**\) to build independent experiences.

## Digital Transformation

This **digital transformation towards investing in a mobile and cloud-first world** brings new opportunities. So businesses are continually thinking about how they can:

* Empower employees
* Engage customers
* Optimise operations
* Transform products

This presents opportunities which Microsoft has created **four solution areas** to tackle.

1. Modern workplace
2. Business applications
3. Applications & infrastructure
4. Data & AI

### Modern Workplace

The modern workplace involves using technology to **empower employees in every organisation to be more creative and collaborate by integrating tech into their workflow**. Since the workplace is transforming to be more involved with technology, the culture can shaped depending on how well this technology is used. So it's in everyone's interest to have **a solution that empowers employees to be more productive and allow them to achieve more**.

To address this need to keep up with technology in the workplace, Microsoft introduced **Microsoft 365** - a platform that allows users to utilise their productivity tools and software in **Office 365, Windows 10 and Windows Enterprise Mobility & Security.**

{% hint style="info" %}
So essentially **Microsoft 365 is the suite for Office 365 + Windows 10 + Security**
{% endhint %}

To cater towards businesses of different sizes, Microsoft offers different packages with Microsoft 365. For **larger Enterprise customers, Microsoft has Microsoft 365 Enterprise**, whereas for **small business customers, they can afford Microsoft 365 Business**.

So using this, businesses can concentrate on business needs because **Microsoft has taken care of their technology needs**. And all of this is just available easily in one place; through Microsoft 365. Businesses can thereby **reframe what they want to achieve and utilise the tools and infrastructure Microsoft provides to do so**.

## Crossword fun

This task was a fun way to end off the module, with a crossword to fill in Word. Not too hard, and it helps to remember the different solution areas that Microsoft invested in.
