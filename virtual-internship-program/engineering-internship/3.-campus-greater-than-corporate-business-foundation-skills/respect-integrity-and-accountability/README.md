# Respect, Integrity and Accountability

## The values at Microsoft

The values of a company not only determine **how they run the business**, but also how the organisation **operates together internally** and **builds trust with its the public and its employees**.

At Microsoft, it is important that the values they stand for also **align to the company's mission** and **support the culture that they are trying to foster**.

This is because their **values declare how Microsoft interacts with its customers and partners** and brings forward questions on how employees can **demonstrate these values in action** \(by embodying them in things that they do\). As people's perceptions of a person or institutions' **values are shaped by how they act** and if they truly practise what they preach.
