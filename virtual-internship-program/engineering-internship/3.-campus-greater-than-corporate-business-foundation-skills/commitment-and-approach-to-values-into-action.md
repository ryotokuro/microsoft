# Commitment and approach to values into action

So know we know Respect, Integrity and Accountability are Microsoft's company values which they embody in every interaction with customers and employees. Now in this module I looked at Microsoft's **Values in Action**, that is, the values that employees try to apply around different areas inside and outside of the organisation. So this involved doing a bit of [research on their website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/values) and reading employee stories of times where Microsoft's values were demonstrated.
