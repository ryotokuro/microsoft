# Commitment and approach to values into action

So know we know [**Respect, Integrity and Accountability**](https://app.gitbook.com/@ryotokuro/s/microsoft/virtual-internship-program/engineering-internship/3.-campus-greater-than-corporate-business-foundation-skills/respect-integrity-and-accountability) are Microsoft's company values which they embody in every interaction with customers and employees. Now in this module I looked at Microsoft's **Values in Action**, that is, the values that employees try to apply around different areas inside and outside of the organisation. So this involved doing a bit of [research on their website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about/values) by reading employee stories of times where Microsoft's values were demonstrated.

For reference, Microsoft's core values are:

* Innovation
* Diversity & Inclusion
* Corporate Social Responsibility \(CSR\)
* Artificial Intelligence \(AI\)
* Trustworthy Computing

## Innovation

Innovation as a value means that Microsoft brings forward the belief that **technology can and should be used for good; empowering people to change lives**. This means that with meaningful innovation, technology can have a positive impact and **contribute to making the world a better place**. So Microsoft's push for innovation ultimately is to not only make technology accessible, but to also continually push it past its boundaries for the greater good of humanity.

## Diversity & Inclusion

Diversity & Inclusion at Microsoft fosters the understanding that people from all different places are sparsely different, and contribute to the company in their own unique ways. Its the people who make up the organisation who shape the culture of the company and what it does to change. This means that **diversity and inclusion within Microsoft fundamentally helps contribute to innovation** - by bringing together the voices of diverse groups of individuals under the umbrella of Microsoft. In order to achieve such a thing, **Microsoft's acts on diversity and inclusion by always engaging with employees and customers to use their voices to innovate on what the company does and stands for**.

Microsoft has built this value of diversity and inclusion in their company, starting from their mission. To empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more - Microsoft is empowering all individuals regardless of background or who they are in their actions; like **democratising technology such as AI and Mixed Reality**. This value is instilled in employees across the orgnisation such that **no matter what level, role or function** they have at Microsoft, everyone plays a role to creating an inclusive environment so that people can do their best work \(achieve more\).

## Corporate Social Responsibility

With CSR, Microsoft takes the position to **address problems the world is facing** and considers how **technology can be utilised for good**. In order to create a **sustainable future**, Microsoft acts in accordance with their values to provide equal benefits and opportunities to all through technology. The issues that they tackle range from:

* Cybersecurity problems
* Providing information on how people can become employable
* Environment sustainability
* Technology for non-profits
* Accessibility

and many more. This has given rise to different initiatives which used technology to solve problems that people across the world are facing. Things like designing AI to become accessible and funding projects which help make a difference in the world as well as making technology more accessible for those with disabilities - all these things fall under **what Microsoft fights for**.

## Artificial Intelligence

Along with the new wave of AI, Microsoft sees the value and opportunity AI provides and has tried to distribute this technology into the hands of people around the world. Again, this follows their mission of empowerment by using the **potential of AI to extend the capabilities of individuals to be able to be more creative and strategic in order to achieve more.**

## Trustworthy Computing

Microsoft who started as a "computer company" has always had its roots in shaping a unique computing experience in Windows. To this day Microsoft continues to do just that, evolving their software as a leading OS and developing its **security, privacy and reliability**.
