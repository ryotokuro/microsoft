# Confidence in communication

## 1. Have a clear message

Have your messages upfront and know what you are trying to deliver beforehand. To be confident, it's a lot easier if you keep in mind what you are trying to convey. Then you can ensure that with every word and action you are **being consistent with what you are trying to communicate**.

## 2. Deliver with passion

What people take away is **not always what you say, but HOW you say it**. When speaking, you should bring your spirit with you and express yourself in a way that is filled with emotion and drive behind it. There should be weight behind your words such that the listener can feel your conviction and your motivation behind what you're saying. Words for words sake is completely meaningless until you place meaning into it.

## 3. Answer message oriented questions

This again is where keeping those **messages you want to convey** in mind is important, because people will ask you questions to try and get to know you or whatever you're talking about better. So if you're trying to get them to take home the messages, then you need to always **direct your answers towards sending those messages in the end again**.

### **Put yourself in the shoes of the audience**

Keep in mind what is important for the audience to walk away with. If YOU were in the shoes of the audience and listening, what would you need to hear in order to get the message that you want to send? It's really up to you to do well - the **audience wants you to succeed**, just like your interviewer wants you to do well and find that you're the perfect candidate.
