## 1. Have a clear message

Have your messages upfront and know what you are trying to deliver beforehand. To be confident, it's a lot easier if you keep in mind what you are trying to convey. Then you can ensure that with every word and action you are **being consistent with what you are trying to communicate**.

## 2. Deliver with passion

What people take away is **not always what you say, but HOW you say it**. When speaking, you should bring your spirit.
