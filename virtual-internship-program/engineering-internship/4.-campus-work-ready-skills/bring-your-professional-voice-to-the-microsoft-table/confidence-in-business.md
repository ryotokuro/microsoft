# Confidence in business

## **Be clear on your views**

Know what you believe in and understand why you have these beliefs. This is so you can communicate with clarity so others can take in your ideas properly. By truly understanding your views you have the ability to discern when it is appropriate to input and maintain respect during discourse.

Part of this means that you need to be prepared for when you have disagreements with views that differ from yours and stay confident by sticking to what you believe in. Being clear is therefore crucial in this instance as it helps you justify your viewpoint and clearly state your ideas without people taking it wrongly.

Having clarity on your views equates to having a clear mind where you can process what others are saying and have a meaningful discussion that isn't one-sided. This gives you confidence in the face of challenges where you can continue to listen and even **engage by asking direct questions to one another**.

Above all, confidence means that you have fully looked into yourself and are able to **convey a particular message about your value** to others. This is easier when your **confidence stems from your genuine self** such that you can stay firm against social pressure or when it is risky. When emotions start to boil, confidence will keep you deeply rooted and stay grounded without being swept away.
