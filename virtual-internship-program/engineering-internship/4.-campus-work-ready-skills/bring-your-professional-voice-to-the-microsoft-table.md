# My professional voice \(be confident\)

## My presentation

Create a PowerPoint presentation consisting of three slides that answer the following questions:

* [ ] _**Slide 1**_: What is confidence and why it is important to demonstrate it in the workplace?
* [ ] **Slide 2:** Think of a friend, colleague or leader who demonstrates confidence. What are the key characteristics that this person demonstrates?
* [ ] **Slide 3**: How can you demonstrate confidence and bring your voice to the table at Microsoft?

## Understanding confidence

![Confidence is how you are perceived by others](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28173%29.png)

Confidence is a **representation of how competent you are to others**. It's hard to definitively measure how competent someone is at their job or how well they will fare in certain tasks or under different conditions. That's why confidence is important to **convey to others that you are important and that you do bring value**.

Results don't always speak for themselves - simply because sometimes results cannot be directly attributed to individuals. Whether a person makes a sale cannot always be directly because of their skill, as there could be a variety of factors that cause that to happen. Good marketing could lead someone to that sale, or competition could drive sales away - both which are independent and unrelated to the salesperson themselves.

Since it's often difficult to distinguish luck from performance, people evaluate your competence based on how you carry yourself. This means that it is **extremely important to convey confidence when faced with hypothetical situations** to avoid being perceived as less than competent by first impression.

Moreover, your **own attitude can affect how well you perform**. In games, if you have the idea that **you can lose from the beginning**, this can influence how you play and may deter you from making risky or blind you from seeing obvious ploys. This idea of **tilt** is so powerful that it can cause a person to drive themselves to the ground and limit their potential behind their own mindset. Consequently, having an air of confidence that you can do it, will positively affect your performance and push you to do better than not.

## Why do people value confidence?

An explanation that I find is easy to comprehend is that **once people are told something and accept the fact, they will often look for evidence that supports this idea to confirm their belief**. This inclination towards a certain idea means that **the initial impression that you give to others** is critical in how they see you, and will shape the image that they form of you in their head.

This is often denoted as the phenomenon of **'Confirmation Bias'** where people have a tendency to focus on things that confirm their belief system. It's this reason that make people fixed towards their own contentions and why you may deviate towards those who have something in common or think alike; resulting in factions, cults, groups, etc.

So essentially, if you **project confidence**, others will believe your words and look to **filter information that supports their impression of you.**

## Don't fake confidence, but recognise your worth

While confidence should be displayed, you shouldn't blindly project false confidence as it portrays a false image of you. One should be confident, but also **aware of their own shortcomings** and where they can communicate lack of ability/knowledge - that too is a strength of communication. For **genuine confidence, you should seek to understand your own worth and where your strengths lie**.

The importance of confidence stems from the idea that **too much comes across as arrogant and boastful** whereas being **too humble and meek** builds on the possibility of failure when others are considering you as part of the equation. Think about it - who would you realistcally rely upon? Someone who is too shy and unapproachable, or **someone who is confident and sure of them themselves?**

{% hint style="info" %}
If **you yourself cannot trust in your own abilities, how can you expect others to?**  
People will feed off your own energy and accept the image that you bring to them.
{% endhint %}

To convince others of your abilities, you need to **get in the habit of communicating to others what you are good at**. This is especially true in interviews - these people don't know you. They don't know your story, nor have the time to sit and understand everything about you. They can only evaluate what you present to them, and judge whether or not you are good for the job based on your appearance; this pertains to your behaviour, actions and speech.

## Authentic confidence is understanding yourself

To be fully confident in yourself, you need to **understand what value you have as a person**. This can be determined by asking yourself things such as:

* What am I good at?
* What has been my greatest success so far?
* Why should others be led by me?
* What do I know that others don't?

Similarly for jobs, you have similar questions to the same end:

* What are your strengths and weaknesses?
* What is your experience with?
* Why are you good for this position?

**You cannot expect to convince others if you have not convinced yourself** of your own worth. This is what confidence is. To recognise you are worthy is daring, and can lead to challenges for yourself - but that alone spurs on your growth. Being confident isn't limited to simply **praising yourself of your abilities but even simply displaying optimism in the face of adversity** shows others that you are a rock they can rely on.

People will naturally gravitate to those who appear strong as those are the ones who rise and become **leaders**. This is the voice that is the clearest in the storm and stands firm and confident in their position. By being confident, you set yourself up to be **recognised for your accomplishments and competence**.
