# The importance of your personal brand

## A personal brand

Especially in this time, finding work has never been so competitive. It's a hard world out there, and to **stand out as an individual** requires some thorough development on how you present yourself to the workforce. It's really about **displaying the best representation of you in an authentic way to the public;** which includes not only your profile on the Internet, but also in person. An authentic personal brand is **consistent in person and online** and is **brought out by WHAT you do and HOW you do it**. Your words and actions will reflect your own self to those around, so the way you carry yourself is extremely important as it defines a significant part of your image.
