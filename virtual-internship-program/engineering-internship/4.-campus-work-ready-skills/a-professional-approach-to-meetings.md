# A professional approach to meetings

With virtual meetings now becoming more prevalent than ever, knowing how to conduct yourself in a meeting as a participant is important to understand how to contribute and bring your voice into the discussion. What has seemed to occur in meetings now is that employees either:

* team members speak up and are more active because they feel **more comfortable to interact without fear of judgement online**
* members switch off in meetings; being silent or non-responsive and just listening into the meeting

## Tips for contributing to meetings

### 1. Be Prepared

Being prepared is first **knowing and understanding what the meeting is for**. Meetings exist for a purpose - there should be points of discussion and topics to be addressed for it to have meaning. A meeting without a proper agenda is meaningless, and requires something of significant importance that cannot be settled with a short interaction.

As a participant in a meeting, you should be prepared to **contribute to the meeting -** which starts with **knowing what the meeting is about** and **what views you have on the matter being discussed**. Figuring out your position on what the meeting is addressing will be useful to help you be clear when communicating and allow you to be more open to what others have to say on the matter.

If you are appropriately prepared for the meeting, you should be **able to speak with confidence** and **convey your opinions with clarity.** This is especially important as your say in the meeting can directly impact the flow of the meeting and the resultant decision.

### **2. Convey ideas simply, but with enthusiasm**

Conveying ideas simply can be achieved by first being **clear on your position** and using **language that is accessible to all participants in the meeting**. It is important that all attendees understand what you are saying and be able to process your opinion on different matters. In technical fields this becomes a delicate area because there is a lot of **specialist jargon and industry specific language** that perhaps not all participants will understand. Knowing **WHO is in attendance in the meeting and their background** can be helpful in deciding what kind of language to use, and whether to be abstract or specific when talking.

Moreover, **capturing the attention of the room** and making sure that you are being succinct and valuable in the meeting is critical such that you don't get distracted or bore the room. To address this, you simply need to be **authentic when talking** - speak from the heart and **deliver with passion and enthusiasm**. If there is energy and weight behind your words, people will want to listen and hear your opinion. Confidence is attractive.

### **3. Stay on topic and discuss the end result**

The most important thing in meetings is to **stay on track** and make sure that **all matters are addressed in the meeting so that it doesn't go on for the whole day**. No one wants to be stuck in a meeting all day and end up getting nothing done. So keep yourself and your colleagues in check by **reminding each other what the purpose of the meeting is for** so that no time is wasted debating unecessary topics. By **focusing on the matters that are important, you make sure that everyone's time is used meaningfully and not wasted.**

### 4. Don't be afraid to highlight issues

It's easy to agree and go along with the flow of the meeting, so that makes it all the more crucial that any issues are ironed out and brought to attention by disrupting this flow. People tend to be agreeable by nature in groups to avoid conflict, but **meetings are the place to bring up these issues and discuss them in the first place**. Therefore, you shouldn't hold back anything as highlighting issues are a form of **contribution** that shows that you are **thinking critically and invested in the end result of the topic of discussion**.

### 5. Ask questions

Actively participate and **show your fellow members that you are engaging** with what is being discussed. If someone is done talking, asking questions will show that you have listened, considered what has been said and are interested in working together to address that point.

Asking **open questions encourage debate and stimulate new ideas and opinions from others into the discussion**. By letting these ideas form, you can enter new territory or invite others to explore different perspectives that they may want to share with the team.

Moreover, asking questions **helps your own understanding of the matter**, by allowing others to clarify and share their own point of view.

It is important however to **not interrupt others while they are talking/presenting** but rather **write your questions down while you are listening** and **bring them up after they are finished and there is an appropriate moment for questions/discussion**. This is again so you do not stray away from the topic and distract the speaker from what they are saying.
