## Docker

### The docker-file starts with an image

* it's the starting point
* What you produce as an output
* You can relate this to a CLASS, sort of like a template

### Container

* Is an image that is running
* Takes an image that is read only
* Adds a writable layer on that image
* So we create a container using an image

### Host

* The machine docker is installed on

### Docker Command Line

```text
docker run -it --rm ubuntu /bin/bash
```
