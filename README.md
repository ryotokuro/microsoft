## Why Microsoft?

I really like Microsoft as a company and I want to work there someday. So here's a space for all of my research and activities that involve Microsoft so that it's all in one place. Just everything that the company stands for and how Satya has now shaped its culture to be aligns with my ideals and philosophy. **As Microsoft has matured over the years, so too have I grown alongside the technology that they bring out**.

At the end of the day, what inspires me to become an engineer is to mark change upon the world. With Microsoft, this idea is echoed, centred around a **mission of empowerment**; with the technology they create and the innovations that they continue to push for it has truly **opened up new possibilities for people and advanced how our world operates**.

People can now **achieve more** using the things that Microsoft works on. From open source, to AI for Earth and controls that adapt to the user, Microsoft is always trying to make the world a better place.

Technology has the power to unite us. It inspires us. Technology has taken us places we've only dreamed. It **gives hope to the hopeless, and it has given voice to the voiceless**.
