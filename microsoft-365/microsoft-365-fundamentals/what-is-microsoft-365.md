## What is Microsoft 365?

Microsoft 365 is a **productivity** cloud solution built for businesses and organisations to use to deliver **enhance productivity** and **workflow** for its users. It seems to be mainly targeted as a business package solution, consisting of different **software and tools** that will help businesses do their job and collaborate more effectively.

Especially with **modern workplaces** now having a more diverse work culture and landscape; where **teams are more diverse and also globally distributed**. This is signicant for larger companies, with teams in Australia often working together on projects with teams in the head office, typically based in America.

As such, there exists a need for a solution that delivers a **productivity experience** to cover all the different requirements teams may have. Microsoft seems to have done so providing a plethora of business utility power including such software such as:

* Microsoft Teams
* Microsoft Office \(Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook\)
* Microsoft Windows

With Microsoft 365, Microsoft is tackling the **"needs of the modern workplace"** that pretty much all businesses face on a day to day. For Microsoft 365, they look to tackle 3 core areas being:

1. **Productivity and Teamwork**
2. **Business Management**
3. **Security and Compliance**
