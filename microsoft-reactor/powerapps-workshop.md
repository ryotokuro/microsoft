# PowerApps workshop

This workshop was ran by Bruce Sithole, who has been using 365 for over 10 years. He started building Power Apps to demonstrate the usefulness of CRM software to sales teams where he saw the potential of the platform after building multiple applications.

## About Power Apps

### Problems with building solutions

The traditional model with building solutions poses problems that stem from the **Time to Market** being relatively large. This large amount of time can be attributed to things like:

* Restrictions on **time \(deadlines\) and resource constraints**
  * As many business have a limited budget for different teams and projects, companies are restricted to how much time and resources they can invest into building an application. This deters teams from even attempting to improve their current processes despite the benefit applications can give to productivity due to the difficulty in designing and developing apps. 
  * Moreover, developing applications have a high perceived difficulty; requiring technical expertise and extensive use of design and algorithms. As a result,  businesses disregard using technology to improve their processes as a possibility. 
* **Paper processes**
  * With many businesses built off paper-based processes, there has been a growing dependency on this model. However, this reliance on paper heavily restricts how teams can operate within the business and creates problems for backups, mobility, efficiency and more. While these problems could be easily resolved through technology, the amount of effort required to switch to a modern process can discourage teams from doing so. 
* **Complex processes**
  * As the world changes over time, business processes have to adapt on the fly - often resulting in a build-up of more and more dependencies, which in turn create more complex processes. As a result, employees have become comfortable and reliant on the systems their work is built upon, despite them being slow or clunky.
