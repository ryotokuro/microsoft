# The business value of Power Apps

The point really to drive home is the ability now for anyone to be able to **build their own apps without requiring any traditional code experience \(C, C\#, Java, Python, etc\)**. What this means now is that any person within the workplace is empowered \(has the power\) to be able to customise applications to work best for them.

So instead of requiring a separate IT resource to spend time building an application for the business, the **front-line business personnel** can instead work on the application that they will be using. The advantage of this is that being the primary user, these business people are the **most familiar with their work**. Things like their schedule, how they operate, the intrancate problems that they face can now be solved by them - whatever business solution they come up with can now be easily translated into a business application with their own hands.

This **resolves the intermediate problem** that companies faced with a level of disconnect the business and IT department faces, where the **business users would have trouble translating their vision across to the application developers**. So now, just like how the **Finance department builds and manages their own Excel workbooks** \(creating, managing and balancing the books\), the business users can build their own app that they will use. Any problems with the app can therefore be immediately addressed and resolved by their own hands.

At the end of the day, Power Apps as a digital solution solves many of the problems that businesses face when their system is built on traditional, legacy operations. With the introduction of this technology,  **Microsoft have in a sense given power to the people** to combat things like:

* Reducing paperwork
* Increasing business process efficiencies
* Improving maintainability and consistency across different data sources
* Making app development more accessible
* Opening up the opportunity for more **innovation and digitisation within the business**
* Eliminating troublesome processes that take time and acrue frustration
* Speeding up the process of business delivery
