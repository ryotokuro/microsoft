# Power Apps & what it can do

## Do you need Power Apps?

* [ ] inefficient or legacy business processes
* [ ] system requires a lot of paper
* [ ] sharing Excel workbooks
* [ ] want to perform tasks from different devices

Instead of requiring code with its syntax and machine intracacies, **Power Apps utilises the same principles as Excel, with formulas like `SUM` and `TEXT`.** So in that sense, it's geared towards more business-type people who don't have any experience with coding. That being said, with any sort of simple application idea, you have the capability to build it on Power Apps - and for developers who do have some expertise, you're not held back but rather given more leverage to create more complexity in your app.

## Connectors utilise wherever your data is

In order to take advantage of the data your business leverages, you need to be able to connect that data properly if you are interested in building an app to interact with that information. With over 275, connecting data can be done easily using either the **underlying data service on the Power Platform** also known as **CSD \(Common Data Service\)** or many online data sources. You can connect to multiple different data sources and have that information on-deck during development, making things easy to **unify the data from different applications into one pooled application which brings it all together.**

* Dynamics 365
