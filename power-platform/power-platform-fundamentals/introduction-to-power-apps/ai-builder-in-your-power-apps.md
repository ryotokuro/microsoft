# AI Builder in your Power Apps

With AI Builder, you can now add intelligence into your applications; with functionality such as **image recognition** or **prediction models** without requiring a data science degree or knowledge of advanced linear algebra. Using Microsoft's framework, building your AI Model is now infinitely easier, shaving time off training and configuring your model with a very rigid step by step process \(**wizard-based interface**\). 

Again, AI Builder just like the rest of the Power Platform doesn't require any code for you to utilise Machine Learning; instead you can take advantage of pre-built infrastructure or even custom build your own AI from scratch. This means you can quickly implement **Azure Machine Learning and Cognitive Services** into your application on Day 1!

## Business Card Reader

One ready to use **out-of-the-box AI component is the business card reader**. This AI component first uses object detection/classification when reviewing a photo **determine if it is a business card** and if so, then proceeds to utilise OCR \(**Optical Character Recognition**\) to extract the information from the business card.

This model therefore can easily automate a system to process hundreds and thousands of business cards to obtain business contact information that can be stored elsewhere, removing the need for a human operator to manually read through and input this info into a registry. Implementing and building custom models is thereby made easy, with a **wizard to guide through all the steps from building to training and finally implementing the model into your Power App**.
