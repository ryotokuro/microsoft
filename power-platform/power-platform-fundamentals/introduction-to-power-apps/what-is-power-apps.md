# What is Power Apps?

## Introduction to Power Apps

So Power Apps, it's Microsoft's solution to building apps to utilise data made easy. As is the spirit of the Power Platform, revolving around the use of data in various different ways. As explored previously Power Apps has the ability to drastically improve any paper forms or legacy implementations that are severely outdated due to the multitude of benefits using a superior digital platform.

What's more, as the UI is so simple and **likens to PowerPoint** \(which you've either already used or will know since it's extremely visual and intuitive\), you're able to start building an application with no experience or relevant skillset. Once your application is built, you're able to continue iterating on different devices and **access it anywhere** because it's all **hosted on the Cloud!**
