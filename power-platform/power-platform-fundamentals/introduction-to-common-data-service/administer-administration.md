# Administer \(Administration\)

For **Administration, the Common Data Service has a bunch of options that allow you to manage your different databases** as required. Here you can do a bunch of administrative things such as:

* Create a new database
* Manage permissions for different features
* Change access for users

## Power Apps Admin Centre

On the left hand side of the **Power Apps Admin center** you'll find a few sections that you can configure to affect your Common Data Service.

* **Environments** - List all instances of your Common Data Services
  * Here you can see your different databases \(remember 1 database per environment\) 
* **Data policies** - Here you can set up different policies that will restrict what data can flow in and out of your Common Data Service entities. So you can group **which data sources are allowed to see Business data** and which aren't. 
* **Data integration** - Here you can add some default connections to external data sources. Like connecting your Common Data Service to Salesforce or your SQL. In Data Integration you can monitor these connections and see where connections are made and what they are doing. 
* **Tenant** - This section you go to look at your licences and quotas \(legal things\).
