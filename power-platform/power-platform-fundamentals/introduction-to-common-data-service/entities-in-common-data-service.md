# Entities in Common Data Service

A Common Data Service _Database_ is **one instance** of a Common Data Service which stores data in **standard and custom structures** which we call **entities**.

{% hint style="info" %}
In other words **Standard/Custom Structure that stores data = Entities** \(in CDS\)

Formal: An **entity** is defined as a **logical set of records used to store data**.
{% endhint %}

Entities are similar to _tables_ in a _relational database_, but with entities you can create many different fields around one topic \(like having different rows of information under a sub-heading\).

So you can create many different instances of a Common Data Service \(create many different CDS databases\) to host data for your solution. **When you create a Common Data Service**, the database by default **automatically fills in some standard entities to store data**. This is common across the board - but you can extend upon this to customise your database.
