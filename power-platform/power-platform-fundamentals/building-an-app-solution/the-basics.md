## Power Apps Studio

Power Apps Studio is the web platform where you create, build and deploy your applications. There isn't any client that you can download to build your applications - you can **only work on your Power Apps online through the web interface**. You can access this through the following link:

## Step 1. Choosing an App format

The first step to build your app is the **select the format of your application**: either **Mobile or Tablet**. This determines the size of the canvas adjusted for different screen sizes. Obviously for Mobile you have a smaller screen size and tablet/desktop is at a larger resolution.

One important thing to note is that  
\***Once you choose your format for your app, you CANNOT CHANGE IT\***

## Galleries

The gallery is used to **display a record from a table of data**. The way the record is shown is **according to a gallery template defined**. So to change what fields you show when you use the gallery, you can change the template in settings. After you define your template, **Power Apps will apply this template automatically to all your data**. So whichever dataset you're showing will look for the fields specified and follow the format provided.

## Forms

Forms focus on a **specific record that you might have chosen from the gallery**. So forms are FOCUSED - set on a single record that has been selected from a gallery. You bring a form up by **going through the gallery and picking the record that you want to display on a form**. Forms therefore show a detailed record of what the user wants to see. The different actions you can use on forms are defined by **form modes** - effectively allowing you to use forms for various purposes :\)

## Input Controls

For some interaction within your app, there are **input controls**. These are like the input modes that are offered in HTML or any basic application. Input controls that Power Apps allows include:

* Text inputs
* Buttons
* Dropdown menus
* Toggles
* Date pickers
* Sliders

You can add any of these input controls to any gallery, form or screen. These inputs also allow a bunch of different settings to customise it right for your business.

## Intelligent Controls

For more advanced controls, Power Apps provides access to more intelligent devices. These are external functions such as:

* Cameras
* Barcode scanners
* GPS
* Business card reader \(AI text processing\)
* Object detector \(AI Object detection\)

## Functions

Functions bring all the inputs and data together - combining them for things like **creating formulas in your applications.** In PowerApps it's quite similar to excel - so many of the formulas transfer across
