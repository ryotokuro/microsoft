# Types of flows

## Event-driven flows

This particular flow involves **setting up a TRIGGER** and some **following actions that execute after the trigger**. These flows can then be seen in "My flows" or "Team flows" which affect the **visibility and access** of users. My flows obviously being tied to the individual user and teams having a shared ownership.

## Business process flows

Step-by-step automation following a business process to guide users in your application through an activity. This is used to augment Model-driven apps 

## UI flows

UI flows are unique in using **Robotic Process Automation \(or RPA\)** to basically **record your actions on your computer** and then repeating those actions \(like botting!\). You can then trigger a flow to initiate the UI flow, which can perform that process repeatedly and even have data come in and out of your process. So **UI flow = Botting** does all the work for you.
