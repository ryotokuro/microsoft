# Power Platform Fundamentals

This covers my notes and interpretation of the Microsoft Power Platform as I journey through the Microsoft Learn Modules. In particular, at the end of this experience I should be able to:

* **Understand** the business value and product capabilities of the Power Platform
* **Create** a simple Power App
* **Connect** data in Power Apps using the Common Data Service
* **Build** a Power BI Dashboard
* **Automate** processes with Microsoft Automate
