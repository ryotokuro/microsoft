These are broken down like the following:

## Power BI Online Service

This is the traditional **dashboard view** which shows you the information as a visual representation. You can look at Power BI service to **view dashboards and reports**. This is where all the complexity is abstracted as just shows the general user-interface which is accessible for everyone.

## Power BI Desktop

Power BI Desktop is like the power behind the service. It's here where you do all the **number crunching and configuration to generate business reports** that are then shown in the service.
